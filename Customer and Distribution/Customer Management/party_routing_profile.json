This can include status (such as account in arrears), ratings (such as high value customer) and alerts (such possible fraud activity detected)",
      "role": "The customer profile service domain is used to tune the customer experience during any real-time interaction with the bank. A collection of status indicators, ratings and alerts can be maintained that are then used to influence the routing and servicing decisions that govern the customer interaction. For example a status indicator could include a warning that the account is in distress which would limit sales activity and might result in routing a contact to a specialist account recovery servicing facility.",
