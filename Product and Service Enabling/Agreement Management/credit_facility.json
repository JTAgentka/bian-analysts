    "definition": "The Credit Facility Service Domain manages the Credit Facilities that a Corporate Customer has with the bank. A Credit Facility is an agreement between the bank and a (corporate) customer to allow the customer to acquire asset products from the bank up to the limit of the credit facility without the need for a full due diligence and underwriting for each of these products.",
    "role": "The Credit Facility Service Domain manages the Credit Facilities that a Corporate Customer has with the bank. A Credit Facility is an agreement between the bank and a (corporate) customer to allow the customer to acquire asset products from the bank up to the limit of the credit facility without the need for a full due diligence and underwriting for each of these products. Credit Facilities can have a hierarchy and they come under the overall Credit Limit for the customer, which is the bank-internal maximum credit exposure that the bank is willing to have with the customer.",
    "example": "Credit Facilties can typically be used to attach trade financing products and also overdrafts in current account where quick processing is demanded by the customer. A Credit Facility is with one customer, but the overall Credit Limit under which Credit Facilities come, can be for more than one customer, typically belonging to one customer group. Credit Facilities within a Credit Facility hierarchy can be for different, but usually related, customers.",
