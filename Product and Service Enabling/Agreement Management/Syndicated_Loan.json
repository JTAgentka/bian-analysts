      "role": "This service domain fulfills a syndicated loan, including the coordination with syndicate members and clarification/administration of their obligations under the arrangement. It is assumed the bank is acting as the syndicate lead in this arrangement, coordinating with other lending banks in the syndicate in order to manage the transfer of funds. The syndicated loan can be for a single amount or be implemented as a more general loan facility that the customer can draw upon over its term. Note that initial customer offer processing may have covered many of these tasks informally, but once the syndicated loan initiation is made more formal syndicate arrangements must be established as an aspect of fulfillment handled here",
      "example": "A major corporate customer obtains a syndicated loan to finance a major project and the bank arranges to distribute the loan with several other interested banks to share the loan exposure",
