      "role": "This service domain tracks and reports on the state (e.g. suspended, flagged for possible fraud, cancelled) for all issued devices. This covers credit/debit cards and can include other identification devices such as keychain fobs and virtual authentication devices such as electronic signatures, passwords and keys. It may use an external service provider to obtain notifications and is responsible for providing notifications to external services when the bank detects problems with its own issued devices",
      "example": "A tracking service notifies the bank that one of its issued authentication devices has been detected in a fraudulent transaction. The bank suspends the device and initiates a fraud case to diagnose and resolve the situation",
