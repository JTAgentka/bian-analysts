      "example": "A card account is canceled when the age of outstanding balance exceeds policy limits (normally 90 days) or when delinquency management and dunning efforts are determined to be unsuccessful at eliciting payment. The account is then assigned to an internal Collections department or an external Collection Agency for making aggressive attempts at securing the payment of the outstandings.",
